Please develop responses that clearly express your ideas in the most succinct manner possible.  You are not permitted to
complete this examination in conjunction with any of your classmates.  Furthermore, you cannot consult any outside
references during this examination.  If you have questions concerning the problems that are listed on these pages,
please visit my office during the examination period.  If you leave the classroom to take the exam, you are responsible
for checking the white board for updates.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item ({\bf 10 Points}) The {\tt Queue} is an abstract data type that
    adheres to the ``first in, first out'' (FIFO) discipline.  Answer
    the following questions about {\tt Queue}s.

    \begin{enumerate}
        %%     \item ({\bf 2 Points}) Suppose that $N$ denotes the size of the
        %%       array that is used to implement a {\tt Queue}.  Furthermore,
        %%       assume that $f$ represents the {\tt int} pointer to the front of
        %%       the {\tt Queue} and $r$ is the {\tt int} pointer to the rear of
        %%       the {\tt Queue}.  What is the equation to calculate the size of
        %%       the {\tt Queue} that uses a circular array?  Your response
        %%       should include the general equation, example values for the
        %%       three variables, and a demonstration of how to calculate the {\tt
        %%       Queue} size for these variables.

        %%     \item ({\bf 6 Points}) It is possible to implement a {\tt Queue}
        %%       that contains an array that is accessed in a circular fashion.
        %%       In your response this question, you may assume that an instance
        %%       of {\tt ArrayQueue} contains an internal array {\tt storage[]}
        %%       of size three.  For each of the following {\tt Queue}
        %%       operations, show the state of {\tt storage[]} and the values for
        %%       {\tt f}, the ``front'' pointer, and {\tt r}, the ``rear''
        %%       pointer.

        %%     \begin{verbatim}
        %%        1. enqueue(100), 2. dequeue(), 
        %%        3. enqueue(200), 4. dequeue(), 
        %%        5. enqueue(300), 6. dequeue()
        %%     \end{verbatim}

        %% \item ({\bf 2 Points}) It is possible to implement the {\tt Queue}
        %%   data structure with a circular array.  If {\tt dequeue} updates
        %%   the $f$ pointer and {\tt enqueue} changes the $r$ pointer, then
        %%   what assignment statements do these operations use to modify
        %%   their pointers?

      \item ({\bf 5 Points}) Furnish an implementation of a complete
        Java program that accepts an arbitrary number of command-line
        arguments and then places the arguments into a {\tt Queue}.
        Assuming that the {\tt enqueue} of a single argument is the
        basic operation, what is the worst-case time complexity of this
        method?  Your response to this question should include a
        justification for your chosen time complexity.

      \item ({\bf 5 Points}) Draw a table that has three columns.  Label the first column ``Operation'', the second
        column ``Output'', and the third column ``front $\leftarrow Q \leftarrow$ rear''.  Populate the second and third
        columns with the output and {\tt Queue} state, respectively, that are created by the following sequence of
        operations, executed in numerically increasing order.  Please place one operation on each row of the table.

            \begin{verbatim} 
              1. enqueue(55), 2. enqueue(13), 
              3. dequeue(),   4. enqueue(79),
              5. dequeue(),   6. front(), 
              7. dequeue(),   8. dequeue() 
            \end{verbatim}

        \end{enumerate}

        \newpage

        %% The extendable array data structure uses an underlying array that can
        %% grow when its space is exhausted.

      \item ({\bf 10 Points}) The linked list is a data structure that
        enables other structures to grow in a dynamic fashion.  However, it
        is also possible to implement a {\tt Stack} and a {\tt Queue} with
        an array.  Answer the following questions about the trade-offs
        associated with using linked lists and arrays to implement data
        structures like the {\tt Stack} and the {\tt Queue}.

        \begin{enumerate}

            %%   \item ({\bf 5 Points}) Clearly explain what happens when an
            %%     extendable array is full and then the {\em add(i,e)} method is
            %%     invoked. You should discuss the four steps that must be taken in
            %%     order to properly handle this type of situation.  Your response
            %%     must also explain how the garbage collector (GC) within the Java
            %%     virtual machine (JVM) is used during memory management.

            %%   \item ({\bf 6 Points}) Identify the similarities and differences
            %%     between the {\tt java.util.Vector} and the {\tt
            %%       java.util.ArrayList}.  Your response should explain similarities
            %%     and differences related to both the performance and the
            %%     functionality of these implementations of the extendable array
            %%     abstract data type (ADT).

          \item ({\bf 4 Points}) Clearly explain the structure of the {\tt Node} and the {\tt DNode}.  Your response
            should indicate which of these types is used for the singly linked list and which is used for the doubly
            linked list.  Finally, your answer should include a separate graphical depiction of the {\tt Node} and the
            {\tt DNode}.

            %%   \item ({\bf 2 Points}) Two important data structures include the
            %%     linked list (LL) and the doubly linked list (DLL).  Please furnish
            %%     a clearly labelled diagram that explains the structure of the node
            %%     that makes up an LL and a DLL.

          \item ({\bf 4 Points}) It is possible to implement a stack with either a linked list or a fixed-size array.
            What are the trade-offs associated with the array-based and linked list-based approaches to implementing a
            stack?  In your response to this question, you may use the abbreviation ``AS'' to refer to the array-based
            stack and ``LLS'' to stand for the stack that uses a linked list as its storage mechanism.

          \item ({\bf 2 Points}) Suppose that you have a properly implemented array-based queue and linked list-based
            queue.  What is the worst-case time complexity of the {\tt dequeue} method for both of these queue
            implementations?  Your response to this question should include a clear justification for your chosen
            time complexities.

            %%   \item ({\bf 4 Points}) Sketch the implementation of either the {\em
            %%     add(i,e)} or {\em remove(i)} method that is part of a simple
            %%     array-based implementation of an extendable array.  Your sketch
            %%     should clearly explain how to perform the shifting of array
            %%     elements.  The parameter $i$ denotes the index subject to addition
            %%     or removal and the parameter $e$ represents the data element that
            %%     must be added.

            %%   \item ({\bf 2 Points}) Suppose that we were interested in storing an
            %%     instance of an extendable array on the file system.  Explain how
            %%     we could use a Java serialization primitive to perform this
            %%     operation.  What is the difference between the XStream serialization
            %%     primitive and the traditional Java serialization primitive?

        \end{enumerate}

        \newpage

      \item ({\bf 10 Points}) The {\tt Stack} is an abstract data type (ADT)
        that adheres to the ``last in first out'' (LIFO) discipline.  Answer
        the following questions about the {\tt Stack} ADT.

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item ({\bf 5 Points}) Provide a Java-based pseudo-code implementation (or, just plain pseudo-code
            implementation) of the {\tt push} and {\tt pop} methods for a simple array-based implementation of the {\tt
            Stack}.  You can assume that the {\tt Stack} is implemented with a fixed-size array called {\tt S} and the
            top of the stack pointer is stored in an {\tt int} variable called {\tt t}. Are these methods efficient?
            Why?

          \item ({\bf 5 Points}) The {\tt Stack} abstract data type provides the methods such as {\tt isEmpty}, {\tt
            top}, {\tt push}, and {\tt pop}.  What is the worst-case time complexity for each of these methods?  Why did
            you pick these complexities? If we assume that an $n$ element array called {\tt S} is used to store the
            elements in the {\tt Stack}, what is the worst-case space complexity of the array-based {\tt Stack}
            implementation? Why?

            %% \item ({\bf 2 Points}) Using one or more diagrams and a textual
            %%   explanation, please demonstrate how to use a {\tt Stack} to
            %%   implement the ``simplified back button'' functionality as found in
            %%   a Web browser such as Lynx.

        \end{enumerate}

        \newpage

      \item ({\bf 10 Points}) Goodrich and Tamassia claim that the {\tt
          Stack} ADT is the ``simplest of all data structures.''  Answer the
        following questions about the {\tt Stack}.

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item ({\bf 5 Points}) Draw a table that has three columns.  Label the first column ``Operation'', the second
            column ``Output'', and the third column ``Stack Contents''.  Populate the second and third columns with the
            output and {\tt Stack} state, respectively, that are created by running the following sequence of
            operations.  You can place one operation on a single row; make sure that you clearly indicate where the top
            of the stack is in your column that describes the state of the {\tt Stack}.

            \begin{verbatim} 
              1. push(15),    2. push(32), 
              3. pop(),       4. push(79),
              5. pop(),       6. top(), 
              7. pop(),       8. pop() 
            \end{verbatim}

            \vspace*{-.3in}

          \item ({\bf 2 Points}) The Java virtual machine (JVM) uses both a stack and a heap.  Please clearly explain
            how the JVM uses these data structures to support the correct execution of a Java program; your response
            should include a diagram.

            %% \item ({\bf 2 Points}) The time complexity of the {\tt LinkedList}'s
            %%   {\em get(i)} method is given as $O(min(i+1, n-i))$.  Clearly explain
            %%   the meaning of this time complexity.  Your response to this question
            %%   should state the meaning of the variables $i$ and $n$.  Finally,
            %%   please identify the worst-case input parameter for the {\em get}
            %%   method.  Your response should include a graphical depiction of an
            %%   instance of the {\tt LinkedList} class.

          % \item ({\bf 4 Points}) Explain which methods of the array-based {\tt
          %     Stack} abstract data type can throw the {\tt EmptyStackException}
          %   and the {\tt FullStackException}.  Your response to this question
          %   should discuss why your selected methods can throw these exceptions.
          %   Your answer should also include a graphical depiction of a {\tt
          %     Stack} for each circumstance in which an exception can be thrown.

          \item ({\bf 3 Points}) You can implement a {\tt Stack} using either an array or a linked list. Two exceptions
            that may be thrown by the methods of these {\tt Stacks} may include the {\tt EmptyStackException} and
            the {\tt FullStackException}.  For an array-based and a linked list-based stack, what methods can throw
            these two exceptions?  Why do your selected methods throw these exceptions?
            
            % throw these exceptions.  Your answer should also include a graphical depiction of a {\tt Stack} for each
            % circumstance in which an exception can be thrown.

        \end{enumerate}

        \newpage

      % \item ({\bf 10 Points}) The {\tt Queue} is important abstract data
      %   types (ADT) that is used in many real-world software applications
      %   like operating systems.  Answer the following questions about the
      %   design, implementation, and evaluation of this abstract data type.

        % \begin{enumerate}

            %%   \item ({\bf 2 Points}) Clearly explain the structure of the {\tt
            %%     Node} and the {\tt DNode}.  Your response should indicate which of
            %%     these types is used for the singly linked list and which is used
            %%     for the doubly linked list.  Finally, your answer should include a
            %%     simple graphical depiction of the {\tt Node} and the {\tt DNode}.

            %% \item ({\bf 4 Points}) Completely describe the operation of the {\tt

            %% operations for a {\tt DoubleEndedQueue} that is implemented with a 
            %% doubly linked list.  Your response should explain when (and if!) any 
            %% of these methods could throw an exception.

            %%   \item ({\bf 2 Points}) The {\tt java.util.Vector} has a constructor
            %%     that accepts two parameters in the following manner: {\tt
            %%       Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement)}.  Explain
            %%     the purpose of each parameter and discuss how it will impact the
            %%     performance of the {\tt Vector} abstract data type.

            %% \item ({\bf 3 Points}) What is a {\tt java.util.Iterator}?  Write a
            %%   short code segment to demonstrate the use of an {\tt Iterator}.
            %%   Your response should explain how an {\tt Iterator} is extracted from
            %%   a {\tt java.util.ArrayList} and fully describe the methods furnished
            %%   by an instance of {\tt Iterator}.  As part of your response to this
            %%   question, you can assume that an {\tt ArrayList} called {\tt
            %%     number\_list} has already been populated with subclasses of {\tt
            %%     java.lang.Number}.

            %%   \item ({\bf 4 Points}) Many programming languages, such as Java,

            %%   furnish two diagrams that separately describe an {\em efficient}
            %%   and {\em inefficient} implementation of a {\tt Queue} with a {\tt
            %%     LinkedList}.  Your diagrams should clearly mark the front and
            %%   rear of the {\tt Queue} and the positioning of the {\tt
            %%     LinkedList} inside of the {\tt Queue}.  Finally, you must

            %%   inefficient.

            %% \item ({\bf 2 Points}) What is a compression algorithm and when
            %%   would you use it?  Next, suppose that you decided to input a
            %%   populated instance of the {\tt ArrayBlockingQueue} class into a
            %%   compression technique.  If $L_B$ is the size of the {\tt

            %%   size {\em after} compression, then how would you calculate the
            %%   {\em percent reduction} (PR) of the {\tt ArrayBlockingQueue}?
            %%   Your response to the second part of this question should include
            %%   an equation that the defines the percent reduction.  What does it
            %%   mean if PR is positive or negative?

 %       \item ({\bf 2 Points}) A complete implementation of an {\tt
    %           ArrayQueue} requires the creation and use of the following
    %         interface:

    %         \vspace*{-.1in}

    %         \begin{verbatim}
    %           public interface Queue<E>

    %           \item What is the meaning of the term {\tt interface}?

    %           \item What is the meaning of the notation {\tt Queue<E>}?

    %         \end{enumerate}

    %       \item ({\bf 4 Points}) Suppose that you are implementing a {\tt Queue}
    %         with an array called {\tt Q}.  In this implementation, {\tt Q[0]}
    %         always denotes the front of the {\tt Queue} and the structure is
    %         allowed to grow from there.  Is this an efficient design? Why or why
    %         not?

    %       \item ({\bf 4 Points}) The double-ended queue, or deque, is a separate
    %         data structure from the queue.  What are the similarities and
    %         differences between the deque and the queue?  Your response to this
    %         question should include details about the names and behavior of the

    %     \end{enumerate}

 \item ({\bf 10 Points}) The extendable array data structure uses an
  underlying array that can ``grow'' when its space is exhausted.
  Answer these questions about this data type.

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item ({\bf 4 Points}) Clearly explain what happens when an
    extendable array is full and then the {\tt add(i,e)} method is
    invoked. Using one or more diagrams, you should discuss the four
    steps that must be taken in order to properly handle this type of
    situation.  Your response must also explain how the garbage
    collector (GC) within the Java virtual machine (JVM) is used
    during memory management.

  %% \item ({\bf 3 Points}) Identify the similarities and differences
  %%   between the {\tt java.util.Vector} and the {\tt
  %%     java.util.ArrayList}.  Your response should explain similarities
  %%   and differences related to both the performance and the
  %%   functionality of these implementations of the extendable array
  %%   ADT.

  \item ({\bf 4 Points}) What are the similarities and differences
    between an array and the {\tt java.util.ArrayList}?  Your answer
    must identify similarities and differences in both the performance
    and the functionality of these data structures.

%%   \item ({\bf 5 Points}) Suppose that an {\tt ArrayList} called {\tt
%%     numberList} contained data values that we wanted to store on the
%%     file system.  What source code would you write to serialize and
%%     deserialize {\tt numberList} using either XStream or binary
%%     serialization with Java?  Your response to this question should
%%     include a diagram that explains the full process of serialization
%%     and deserialization.  Finally, you may assume that {\tt
%%       numberList} only contains instances of {\tt java.lang.Integer}.

  %% \item ({\bf 2 Points}) What is a {\tt java.util.Iterator}?  Your
  %%   answer should clearly discuss the steps that must be taken to
  %%   create and then use an instance of the {\tt Iterator} class.  Why
  %%   might a Java programmer who wants to print out each element in an
  %%   {\tt ArrayList} use an {\tt Iterator} instead of a {\tt for} loop?

  \item ({\bf 2 Points}) Declaring an {\tt ArrayList} with the statement ``{\tt ArrayList list = new
      ArrayList();}'' will cause the Java compiler to produce this warning:
